# task8 - Compeleted âœ…
This was one of those tricky tasks which looked tough, but turned out to be really simple with those ```TODO List``` inside the code.

- I had little bit experience in ```HTML```, ```CSS``` and ```JSS``` hence this task was pretty straightforward for me.
- Made few changes in the css sheet implementation and add few functionalities in the other two pages and tadaa our web page is working fine....
