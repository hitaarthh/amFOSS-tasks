# task9 - Simple Portfolio Website

Head over to my <a href="https://hitaarthh.github.io/">Portfolio</a> and give your valuable suggestions üòá.

‚ö°Ô∏è I enjoyed making this task and felt really well while making my own personal website, which will have my list of works and Projects in future.

‚ö°Ô∏è While doing this Project i really felt exultant and realised maybe FrontEnd is my thing i love making websites, webapps, and other UI design things.

‚ö°Ô∏è I used github pages for hosting, i have applied for DNS for my  personal custom domain name, through GitHub Student Developer Pack and soon expecting it.
