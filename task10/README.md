# task10 - Completed âœ…
- This task was bit easy for me as i had worked few problem set of these tasks in my class 12th when i started learning ``Scratch`` and ``Python``
- I have only completed the pset till week4 due to my own personal deadline(Had to reach hostel in few days), else im still continuing with the lecture materials.
- This gave me a wonderful experience in studying the ```CS50``` harvard tasks.
