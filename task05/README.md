# task5 - Completed âœ…

This task turned out nightmare for me ðŸ¤¯ as i had no previous experience into C programming and this was something related to debugging but then things turned out to me fine for me after google searches and pdfs.

## Explanation:
- First i saw few portions of code being commented out and hence i brought them back to the code.
- I even found errors in the code regarding the positioning of brackets ```{}``` which was also resolved after few clicks and backspaces.
- There was also error in the logic implementation of the particular given piece of code, so i made some changes and fixed some bugs.
###### Code Snippet where i made changes.:

```sh 
switch(choice)
    {
        case 0:
	        printf("\n\t||===== ");
	        printf("\n\t||    | ");
	        printf("\n\t||   %cO/",'\\');
	        printf("\n\t||    | ");
	        printf("\n\t||   / %c",'\\');
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	    break;
        case 1:
            system("clear");
	        printf("\n\t||===== ");
	        printf("\n\t||    | ");
	        printf("\n\t||   %cO/",'\\');
	        printf("\n\t||    | ");
	        printf("\n\t||     %c",'\\');
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	    break;
        case 2:
            system("clear");
	        printf("\n\t||===== ");
	        printf("\n\t||    | ");
	        printf("\n\t||   %cO/",'\\');
	        printf("\n\t||    | ");
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	    break;
        case 3:
            system("clear");
	        printf("\n\t||===== ");
	        printf("\n\t||    | ");
	        printf("\n\t||   %cO/",'\\');
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	    break;
        case 4:
        system("clear");
	        printf("\n\t||===== ");
	        printf("\n\t||    | ");
	        printf("\n\t||   %cO ",'\\');
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	    break;
        case 5:
            system("clear");
	        printf("\n\t||===== ");
	        printf("\n\t||    | ");
	        printf("\n\t||    O ");
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	        printf("\n\t||      ");
	    break;

    }
