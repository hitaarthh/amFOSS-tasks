# task6 Completed: Flutter UI Design

‚ö°Ô∏è This task was very entertaining and enjoyable at the same time as Flutter UI Development is one of my favourite topics and hence i would rate this task as one of my favourite tasks.

‚ö°Ô∏è This task not only taught me how to use different flutter libraries and Widgetory but also helped me understanding the concepts of OOPs using the dart language.

‚ö°Ô∏è I have implemented concepts like ```Abstraction```, ```Encapsulation```, ```Inheritance(Default inheritance of Flutter classes)``` in this Project.

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun Fact: I have been working on other Simple FLutter projects for now to grasp the idea of Flutter UI Design. Check out my [Flutter Projects](https://github.com/hitaarthh/Flutter-Projects), if you are interested. Feel free to give me your personal suggestions and reviews ‚úåüèªüòá.

## Detailed Explanation of Project:

### Abstraction:
- In simple words abstraction refers to process in which the complex background functions are hidden and user is only provided with the simple tools.For eg, a Car has many complex mechanical systems which are hidden from the user and user is only provided with steering, brakes etc to control the Car. 
- In our Project Abstraction is implented in such a way that all the different functionalities are separated in different classes so that the file ```main.dart``` doesn't look messy, which would eventually help the developer to debug the code.

**``` Abstraction In Real Life: ```** 

Above Given Figure depicts the pillars of a restaurant. All of them have their own significance and area of expertise, but if we consider for a whle that only one person is supposed to do all the different jobs, How messy would that make the management of the restraunt!? Now same is with the class and objects, if we create to many methods serving different purposes in a single class, it would eventually lead to a very chaotic code base which would be very difficult to debug and maintain. Having so many arguments in one single code base might override many functions and the code might not perform the expected task. 

### Encapsulation:
- The term Encapsulation refers to binding data and methods in a single unit called class.
- Encapsulation may also refer to a mechanism of restricting the direct access to some components of an object, such that users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object. Encapsulation can be used to hide both data members and data functions or methods associated with an instantiated class or object.
- In our Project encapsulation has been implemented in such a way that the ``` main.dart``` file cannot alter the details  of other classes properties which might result in giving under desired results.

### Inheritance: 
- Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. 

- The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the Parent/Inherited class and the class that inherits the properties from the parent class is the Child/Derived class.

- Above figure is a family tree which describes the inheritance of characterstics in a particular family. Every child has characterstics inherited from their parents, but they also have their own unique characterstics, which distuinguishes them from each other. 

### Polymorphism:
- Polmorphism is seen in the derived classes. Once a class has inherited characterstics from their parent class, they can explicitly override the properties from the inherited class.
- Polymorphism is also known as Function Overloading and is seen in languages like Java/Dart.

**```Polymorphism In Real Life:```**

We are already very familiar to this Restraunt Code base, let's take the example of our kitchen makers, our chefs', both the cook and pastry chef have inherited there properties from ``` public class kitchen ```. Our Chefs' have some common properties like they both really tasty food, but they have even overrided the properties of their parent class kitchen (By performing polymorphism), the pastry chef has modified itself to be more delicate with the bakery products and our cook has modified itself to serve tasty orders quickly
