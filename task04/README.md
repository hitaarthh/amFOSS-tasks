# task4 - Completed âœ…
This task gave me goosebumps as i was always into space exploration and especially the mars rovers, like curiositty, spirit, persevarance, pathfinder. This task gave me an immense pleasure to see those rovers actually and performing there science ðŸ˜‡.

- Initially i applied for the NASA API key and hence i got my own API key in my mail.
```API KEY- dfqvQhzSE89XQPgSoAIPNiWH1PbZD2iqHsBRc3Te```
- I have set the API key and rover id to default and hence is all set to for our mars exploration project.
- I used the ```parsers``` and ```jsons``` to collect the live web data from the rover.
- Sometimes the downloading takes time, maybe our mars rovers are getting old ðŸ¥².
