## About Me 🤔: 
⚡️ I have been following amFOSS for more than an year now, or i can better say i joined amritapuri campus
because of amFOSS club.

⚡️ I'm interested in learning much about Web Development. I gathered some of my skills loitering over the Internet
in the field of FrontEnd Development, (HTML,CSS,JS to somewhat a beginner level).

⚡️ I'm highly interested in learning Flutter UI development and learnt it to some extent. Check out my [FLutter
Project](https://github.com/hitaarthh/Flutter-Projects), if you are interested.

⚡️ Besides tech i love playing football and games like Call of Duty touch my heart (username: [hitaarthh](), incase you
wanna team up!).
