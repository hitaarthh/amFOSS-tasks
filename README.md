## About Me 🤔: 
⚡️ I have been following amFOSS for more than an year now, or i can better say i joined amritapuri campus
because of amFOSS club.

⚡️ I'm interested in learning much about Web Development. I gathered some of my skills loitering over the Internet
in the field of FrontEnd Development, (HTML,CSS,JS to somewhat a beginner level).

⚡️ I'm highly interested in learning Flutter UI development and learnt it to some extent. Check out my [FLutter
Projects](https://github.com/hitaarthh/Flutter-Projects), if you are interested.

⚡️ Besides tech i love playing football and games like Call of Duty touch my heart (username: [hitaarthh](), incase you
wanna team up!).
  
## --> Why you should choose you?🤔
  - Every other person out there thiks that they have what it takes, but i strongly I'm a person who deeply wishes to contribute to this club and grow along with it, in the beginning of my sem 1 i couldn't complete the task set as i stuck with some personal family issues, but nevertheless i clear the tasks of teamBi0s and currently im a member of teamBi0s and working under that club, still despite of learning assemblyLanguage and playing ctf's im learning technologies like Flutter, Web Development by loitering over the internet, which are also an integral part of amFOSS club and have been still following the amFOSS club despite being in some other organization.
  
## --> What is your plan for the next 6 months?🤔
  - In the next 6 months I'm planning to become a skillfull Flutter Developer and also planning to expand my knowledge in terms of both FrontEnd and BackEnd Development, moreover this I'm also interested in Deep Learning which i would pursuing along with the amFOSS club, if I'm selected.
 
## --> How would you contribute back to the club?🤔
  - In order to contribute to the club I would first like to know how this particular organization works and if i would find some loop holes and voids, then I would be devising methods to eradicate those issues and also try to make approachable in a way which the new Freshers and upcoming students would prefer.
